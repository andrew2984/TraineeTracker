# Trainee Tracker Application

The Trainee Tracker Application is an ASP.NET MVC application that allows trainees to create, read, update, and delete their tracker entries. Trainers can view all entries from all trainees, but they are restricted from creating, editing, or deleting entries. Additionally, an admin user has the authority to access a list of all users. We plan to extend the functionality of the admin role to be able to manage users and their roles.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/andrew2984/TraineeTracker.git

2. Open the project in Visual Studio.

3. Build the solution to restore the NuGet packages.
<br></br>

## Configuration
1. Open the Web.config file in the root directory.

2. Modify the connection string to point to your database.

3. Adjust other configuration settings as required.
<br></br>

## Database Setup
1. Scaffold the database using a Model First Migration
2. Add any initial data using a SQL Query
<br></br>

## Usage
1. Launch the application in Visual Studio or deploy it to a web server.
2. Setup your initial Admin users so they can modify the roles of other users
3. Log in using your credentials.

## Trainee Functionality
- Create Entry: Trainees can create new tracker entries by providing relevant information such as date, time, description, and any other required fields.

- Read Entry: Trainees can view their own tracker entries, displaying the details of each entry, including date, time, description, and other relevant information.

- Update Entry: Trainees can modify their existing tracker entries, updating the information as needed.

- Delete Entry: Trainees can delete their own tracker entries if they are no longer required.

- Filter Entries: Trainees can filter their entries based on the title of each entry.
<br></br>

## Trainer Functionality
- Read Entry: Trainers can view all tracker entries from all trainees, but they cannot create, edit, or delete entries.

- Filter Entries: Trainers can filter their trainees entries based on the title of each entry.
<br></br>

## Admin Functionality
- User Management: Admin users have access to an admin page, where they can view a list of all users registered in the system. 

- *Change User Role (Coming soon): We intend for the admin to be able to edit the roles of other users.*

## Service Layer
The Trainee Tracker Application follows a layered architecture and incorporates a service layer to encapsulate business logic and promote separation of concerns. It contains the core application logic, such as validation, data manipulation, and complex operations. By implementing a service layer, the application achieves better modularity, maintainability, and testability. The service layer allows for easier reuse of business logic across different controllers and promotes a more structured and organized codebase.
<br></br>

## Dependency Injection Container
The Trainee Tracker Application uses a dependency injection (DI) container to manage the dependencies between its components. DI containers  inject dependencies from outside sources rather than creating them internally. This promotes modularity, testability, and flexibility. The application uses a DI container to inject the IService, IMapper and TraineeTrackerContext to wherever they are needed.
